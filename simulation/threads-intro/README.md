# Overview

Welcome to this simulator! The idea is to gain familiarity with threads by
seeing how they interleave; the simulator, `x86.py`, will help you in
gaining this understanding.

The simulator mimicks the execution of short assembly sequences by multiple
threads. Note that the OS code that would run (for example, to perform a
context switch) is *not* shown; thus, all you see is the interleaving of the
user code.

The assembly code that is run is based on x86, but somewhat simplified. 
In this instruction set, there are four general-purpose registers 
(%ax, %bx, %cx, %dx), a program counter (PC), and a small set of instructions
which will be enough for our purposes.

Here is an example code snippet that we will be able to run:

```sh
.main
mov 2000, %ax   # get the value at the address
add $1, %ax     # increment it
mov %ax, 2000   # store it back
halt
```

The code is easy to understand. The first instruction, an x86 "mov", simply
loads a value from the address specified by 2000 into the register %ax.
Addresses, in this subset of x86, can take some of the following forms:

- `2000` : the number (2000) is the address
- `(%cx)` : contents of register (in parentheses) forms the address
- `1000(%dx)` : the number + contents of the register form the address
- `10(%ax,%bx)` : the number + reg1 + reg2 forms the address

To store a value, the same `mov` instruction is used, but this time with the
arguments reversed, e.g.:

```sh
mov %ax, 2000
```

The `add` instruction, from the sequence above, should be clear: it adds an
immediate value (specified by `$1`) to the register specified in the second
argument (i.e., `%ax = %ax + 1`).

Thus, we now can understand the code sequence above: it loads the value at
address 2000, adds 1 to it, and then stores the value back into address 2000.

The fake-ish `halt` instruction just stops running this thread.

Let's run the simulator and see how this all works! Assume the above code
sequence is in the file `simple-race.s`.

```sh
prompt> ./x86.py -p simple-race.s -t 1 

       Thread 0
1000 mov 2000, %ax
1001 add $1, %ax
1002 mov %ax, 2000
1003 halt

prompt> 
```

The arguments used here specify the program (`-p`), the number of
threads (`-t 1`), and the interrupt interval, which is how often a
scheduler will be woken and run to switch to a different task. Because
there is only one thread in this example, this interval does not
matter.

The output is easy to read: the simulator prints the program counter (here
shown from 1000 to 1003) and the instruction that gets executed. Note that we
assume (unrealistically) that all instructions just take up a single byte in
memory; in x86, instructions are variable-sized and would take up from one to
a small number of bytes. 

We can use more detailed tracing to get a better sense of how machine state
changes during the execution:

```sh
prompt> ./x86.py -p simple-race.s -t 1 -M 2000 -R ax,bx

 2000      ax    bx          Thread 0
    ?       ?     ?
    ?       ?     ?   1000 mov 2000, %ax
    ?       ?     ?   1001 add $1, %ax
    ?       ?     ?   1002 mov %ax, 2000
    ?       ?     ?   1003 halt

Oops! Forgot the -c flag (which actually computes the answers for you).

prompt> ./x86.py -p simple-race.s -t 1 -M 2000 -R ax,bx -c

 2000      ax    bx          Thread 0
    0       0     0
    0       0     0   1000 mov 2000, %ax
    0       1     0   1001 add $1, %ax
    1       1     0   1002 mov %ax, 2000
    1       1     0   1003 halt
```

By using the `-M` flag, we can trace memory locations (a
comma-separated list lets you trace more than one, e.g., 2000,3000);
by using the `-R` flag we can track the values inside specific
registers.

The values on the left show the memory/register contents AFTER the instruction
on the right has executed. For example, after the `add` instruction, you can
see that %ax has been incremented to the value 1; after the second `mov`
instruction (at PC=1002), you can see that the memory contents at 2000 are
now also incremented.

There are a few more instructions you'll need to know, so let's get to them
now. Here is a code snippet of a loop:

```sh
.main
.top
sub  $1,%dx
test $0,%dx     
jgte .top         
halt
```

A few things have been introduced here. First is the `test` instruction.
This instruction takes two arguments and compares them; it then sets implicit
"condition codes" (kind of like 1-bit registers) which subsequent instructions
can act upon.

In this case, the other new instruction is the `jump` instruction (in this
case, `jgte` which stands for "jump if greater than or equal to"). This
instruction jumps if the second value is greater than or equal to the first
in the test.

One last point: to really make this code work, `dx` must be initialized to 1 or
greater. 

Thus, we run the program like this:

```sh
prompt> ./x86.py -p loop.s -t 1 -a dx=3 -R dx -C -c

   dx   >= >  <= <  != ==        Thread 0
    3   0  0  0  0  0  0
    2   0  0  0  0  0  0  1000 sub  $1,%dx
    2   1  1  0  0  1  0  1001 test $0,%dx
    2   1  1  0  0  1  0  1002 jgte .top
    1   1  1  0  0  1  0  1000 sub  $1,%dx
    1   1  1  0  0  1  0  1001 test $0,%dx
    1   1  1  0  0  1  0  1002 jgte .top
    0   1  1  0  0  1  0  1000 sub  $1,%dx
    0   1  0  1  0  0  1  1001 test $0,%dx
    0   1  0  1  0  0  1  1002 jgte .top
   -1   1  0  1  0  0  1  1000 sub  $1,%dx
   -1   0  0  1  1  1  0  1001 test $0,%dx
   -1   0  0  1  1  1  0  1002 jgte .top
   -1   0  0  1  1  1  0  1003 halt
```

The `-R dx` flag traces the value of %dx; the `-C` flag traces the values of
the condition codes that get set by a test instruction. Finally, the `-a dx=3`
flag sets the `%dx` register to the value 3 to start with. 

As you can see from the trace, the `sub` instruction slowly lowers the value
of %dx. The first few times `test` is called, only the ">=", ">", and "!="
conditions get set. However, the last `test` in the trace finds %dx and 0 to
be equal, and thus the subsequent jump does NOT take place, and the program
finally halts.

Now, finally, we get to a more interesting case, i.e., a race condition with
multiple threads. Let's look at the code first:

```sh
.main
.top
# critical section
mov 2000, %ax       # get the value at the address
add $1, %ax         # increment it
mov %ax, 2000       # store it back

# see if we're still looping
sub  $1, %bx
test $0, %bx
jgt .top

halt
```

The code has a critical section which loads the value of a variable 
(at address 2000), then adds 1 to the value, then stores it back. 

The code after just decrements a loop counter (in %bx), tests if it
is greater than or equal to zero, and if so, jumps back to the top
to the critical section again.

```sh
prompt> ./x86.py -p looping-race-nolock.s -t 2 -a bx=1 -M 2000 -c

 2000      bx          Thread 0                Thread 1
    0       1
    0       1   1000 mov 2000, %ax
    0       1   1001 add $1, %ax
    1       1   1002 mov %ax, 2000
    1       0   1003 sub  $1, %bx
    1       0   1004 test $0, %bx
    1       0   1005 jgt .top
    1       0   1006 halt
    1       1   ----- Halt;Switch -----  ----- Halt;Switch -----
    1       1                            1000 mov 2000, %ax
    1       1                            1001 add $1, %ax
    2       1                            1002 mov %ax, 2000
    2       0                            1003 sub  $1, %bx
    2       0                            1004 test $0, %bx
    2       0                            1005 jgt .top
    2       0                            1006 halt
```

Here you can see each thread ran once, and each updated the shared
variable at address 2000 once, thus resulting in a count of two there.

The `Halt;Switch` line is inserted whenever a thread halts and another
thread must be run.

One last example: run the same thing above, but with a smaller interrupt
frequency. Here is what that will look like:

```sh
prompt> ./x86.py -p looping-race-nolock.s -t 2 -a bx=1 -M 2000 -i 2

 2000          Thread 0                Thread 1
    ?
    ?   1000 mov 2000, %ax
    ?   1001 add $1, %ax
    ?   ------ Interrupt ------  ------ Interrupt ------
    ?                            1000 mov 2000, %ax
    ?                            1001 add $1, %ax
    ?   ------ Interrupt ------  ------ Interrupt ------
    ?   1002 mov %ax, 2000
    ?   1003 sub  $1, %bx
    ?   ------ Interrupt ------  ------ Interrupt ------
    ?                            1002 mov %ax, 2000
    ?                            1003 sub  $1, %bx
    ?   ------ Interrupt ------  ------ Interrupt ------
    ?   1004 test $0, %bx
    ?   1005 jgt .top
    ?   ------ Interrupt ------  ------ Interrupt ------
    ?                            1004 test $0, %bx
    ?                            1005 jgt .top
    ?   ------ Interrupt ------  ------ Interrupt ------
    ?   1006 halt
    ?   ----- Halt;Switch -----  ----- Halt;Switch -----
    ?                            1006 halt
```

As you can see, each thread is interrupt every 2 instructions, as we specify
via the `-i 2` flag. What is the value of memory[2000] throughout this run?
What should it have been?

Now let's give a little more information on what can be simulated
with this program. The full set of registers: %ax, %bx, %cx, %dx, and the PC. 
In this version, there is no support for a "stack", nor are there call
and return instructions.

The full set of instructions simulated are:

```sh
mov immediate, register     # moves immediate value to register
mov memory, register        # loads from memory into register
mov register, register      # moves value from one register to other
mov register, memory        # stores register contents in memory
mov immediate, memory       # stores immediate value in memory

add immediate, register     # register  = register  + immediate
add register1, register2    # register2 = register2 + register1
sub immediate, register     # register  = register  - immediate
sub register1, register2    # register2 = register2 - register1

test immediate, register    # compare immediate and register (set condition codes)
test register, immediate    # same but register and immediate
test register, register     # same but register and register

jne                         # jump if test'd values are not equal
je                          #                       ... equal
jlt                         #     ... second is less than first
jlte                        #               ... less than or equal
jgt                         #            ... is greater than
jgte                        #               ... greater than or equal

xchg register, memory       # atomic exchange: 
                            #   put value of register into memory
                            #   return old contents of memory into reg
                            # do both things atomically

nop                         # no op
```

Notes: 
- 'immediate' is something of the form $number
- 'memory' is of the form 'number' or '(reg)' or 'number(reg)' or 'number(reg,reg)' (as described above)
- 'register' is one of %ax, %bx, %cx, %dx

Finally, here are the full set of options to the simulator are available with the `-h` flag: 

```sh
Usage: x86.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SEED, --seed=SEED  the random seed
  -t NUMTHREADS, --threads=NUMTHREADS
                        number of threads
  -p PROGFILE, --program=PROGFILE
                        source program (in .s)
  -i INTFREQ, --interrupt=INTFREQ
                        interrupt frequency
  -r, --randints        if interrupts are random
  -a ARGV, --argv=ARGV  comma-separated per-thread args (e.g., ax=1,ax=2 sets
                        thread 0 ax reg to 1 and thread 1 ax reg to 2);
                        specify multiple regs per thread via colon-separated
                        list (e.g., ax=1:bx=2,cx=3 sets thread 0 ax and bx and
                        just cx for thread 1)
  -L LOADADDR, --loadaddr=LOADADDR
                        address where to load code
  -m MEMSIZE, --memsize=MEMSIZE
                        size of address space (KB)
  -M MEMTRACE, --memtrace=MEMTRACE
                        comma-separated list of addrs to trace (e.g.,
                        20000,20001)
  -R REGTRACE, --regtrace=REGTRACE
                        comma-separated list of regs to trace (e.g.,
                        ax,bx,cx,dx)
  -C, --cctrace         should we trace condition codes
  -S, --printstats      print some extra stats
  -c, --compute         compute answers for me
```

Most are obvious. Usage of `-r` turns on a random interrupter (from 1
to intfreq as specified by `-i`), which can make for more fun during
homework problems.

- `-L` specifies where in the address space to load the code.
- `-m` specified the size of the address space (in KB).
- `-S` prints some extra stats
- `-c` is not really used (unlike most simulators in the book); use the tracing or condition codes.

Now you have the basics in place; read the questions at the end of the chapter
to study this race condition and related issues in more depth.

# Questions
1. Let’s examine a simple program, “loop.s”. First, just read and understand it. Then, run it with these arguments (```./x86.py -p loop.s -t 1 -i 100 -R dx```) This specifies a single thread, an interrupt every 100 instructions, and tracing of register %dx. What will %dx be during the run? Use the -c flag to check your answers; the answers, on the left, show the value of the register (or memory value) after the instruction on the right has run.
      ```
      dx          Thread 0         
      0   
      -1   1000 sub  $1,%dx
      -1   1001 test $0,%dx
      -1   1002 jgte .top
      -1   1003 halt
      ```
2. Same code, different flags: (```./x86.py -p loop.s -t 2 -i 100 -a dx=3,dx=3 -R dx```) This specifies two threads, and initializes each %dx to 3. What values will %dx see? Run with -c to check. Does the presence of multiple threads affect your calculations? Is there a race in this code?

      There is no race in this code.
      ```

      ```
3. Run this: ```./x86.py -p loop.s -t 2 -i 3 -r -a dx=3,dx=3 -R dx``` This makes the interrupt interval small/random; use different seeds (-s) to see different interleavings. Does the interrupt frequency change anything?

      No, it changes nothing.

      ```
      ./x86.py -p loop.s -t 2 -i 3 -r -a dx=3,dx=3 -R dx -s 42

4. Now, a different program, looping-race-nolock.s, which accesses a shared variable located at address 2000; we’ll call this variable value. Run it with a single thread to confirm your understanding: ```./x86.py -p looping-race-nolock.s -t 1 -M 2000``` What is value (i.e., at memory address 2000) throughout the run? Use -c to check.
      ```
      2000          Thread 0         
         0   
         0   1000 mov 2000, %ax
         0   1001 add $1, %ax
         1   1002 mov %ax, 2000
         1   1003 sub  $1, %bx
         1   1004 test $0, %bx
         1   1005 jgt .top
         1   1006 halt
      ```
5. Run with multiple iterations/threads: ```./x86.py -p looping-race-nolock.s -t 2 -a bx=3 -M 2000``` Why does each thread loop three times? What is final value of value?

      Because bx is set to 3 for each thread. Final value is 6.

      ```
      2000      bx          Thread 0                Thread 1         
         0       3   
         0       3   1000 mov 2000, %ax
         0       3   1001 add $1, %ax
         1       3   1002 mov %ax, 2000
         1       2   1003 sub  $1, %bx

         6       0                            1006 halt
      ```

6. Run with random interrupt intervals: ```./x86.py -p looping-race-nolock.s -t 2 -M 2000 -i 4 -r -s 0``` with different seeds (-s 1, -s 2, etc.) Can you tell by looking at the thread interleaving what the final value of value will be? Does the timing of the interrupt matter? Where can it safely occur? Where not? In other words, where is the critical section exactly?
      
      The timing of the interrupt matters. To safely write result, reading from memory of one thread(```mov 2000, %ax```) should be done after the other thread finishes writing to memory(```mov %ax, 2000```). Critical section is where multiple thread try to read and write at the same time(in this case memory address 2000).
      ```
      ./x86.py -p looping-race-nolock.s -t 2 -M 2000 -i 4 -r -s 0

7. Now examine fixed interrupt intervals: ./x86.py -p looping-race-nolock.s -a bx=1 -t 2 -M 2000 -i 1 What will the final value of the shared variable value be? What about when you change -i 2, -i 3, etc.? For which interrupt intervals does the program give the “correct” answer?

      Interval of 3 instructions give correct answer because executing three instructions makes atomic behavior of read, increase, write.

8. Run the same for more loops (e.g., set -a bx=100). What interrupt intervals (-i) lead to a correct outcome? Which intervals are surprising?

      Interval of 3, same to the answer to q7.

9. One last program: wait-for-me.s. Run: ```./x86.py -p wait-for-me.s -a ax=1,ax=0 -R ax -M 2000``` This sets the %ax register to 1 for thread 0, and 0 for thread 1, and watches %ax and memory location 2000. How should the code behave? How is the value at location 2000 being used by the threads? What will its final value be?

      value at location 2000 is used to check whether the signal is sent. 
      ```
      2000      ax          Thread 0                Thread 1         
         0       1   
         0       1   1000 test $1, %ax
         0       1   1001 je .signaller
         1       1   1006 mov  $1, 2000
         1       1   1007 halt
         1       0   ----- Halt;Switch -----  ----- Halt;Switch -----  
         1       0                            1000 test $1, %ax
         1       0                            1001 je .signaller
         1       0                            1002 mov  2000, %cx
         1       0                            1003 test $1, %cx
         1       0                            1004 jne .waiter
         1       0                            1005 halt
      ```

10. Now switch the inputs: ```./x86.py -p wait-for-me.s -a ax=0,ax=1 -R ax -M 2000``` How do the threads behave? What is thread 0 doing? How would changing the interrupt interval (e.g., -i 1000, or perhaps to use random intervals) change the trace outcome? Is the program efficiently using the CPU?

      Thread 0 is waiting for thread 1 to be run and update the value at location 2000. Shorter intervel results in faster switch to thread 1, send signal to thread 0. After receiving the signal, thread 0 terminates so the total execution time decrease with shorter intterupt interval.
      ```
