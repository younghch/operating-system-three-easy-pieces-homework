# Overview

Included in this directory are a number of skeletal code fragments, which you
can fill out to solve various synchronization problems. 

And see Allen Downey's book, ["A Little Book of Semaphores"](https://greenteapress.com/semaphores/LittleBookOfSemaphores.pdf), for even more
fun. It's also free!

To compile any one of them (say, one called `foo.c`):

```sh
prompt> gcc -o foo foo.c -Wall -pthread
```

And then, to run it:

```sh
prompt> ./foo
```

(maybe with some optional arguments)

# Questions

1. The first problem is just to implement and test a solution to the fork/join problem, as described in the text. Even though this solution is described in the text, the act of typing it in on your own is worthwhile; even Bach would rewrite Vivaldi, allowing one soon-to-be master to learn from an existing one. See ```fork-join.c``` for details. Add the call sleep(1) to the child to ensure it is working.

2. Let’s now generalize this a bit by investigating the rendezvous problem. The problem is as follows: you have two threads, each of which are about to enter the rendezvous point in the code. Neither should exit this part of the code before the other enters it. Consider using two semaphores for this task, and see ```rendezvous.c``` for details.

3. Now go one step further by implementing a general solution to barrier synchronization. Assume there are two points in a sequential piece of code, called P1 and P2. Putting a barrier between P1 and P2 guarantees that all threads will execute P1 before any one thread executes P2. Your task: write the code to implement a ```barrier()``` function that can be used in this manner. It is safe to assume you know N (the total number of threads in the running program) and that all N threads will try to enter the barrier. Again, you should likely use two semaphores to achieve the solution, and some other integers to count things. See ```barrier.c``` for details.

4. Now let’s solve the reader-writer problem, also as described in the text. In this first take, don’t worry about starvation. See the code in ```reader-writer.c``` for details. Add sleep() calls to your code to demonstrate it works as you expect. Can you show the existence of the starvation problem?

5. Let’s look at the reader-writer problem again, but this time, worry about starvation. How can you ensure that all readers and writers eventually make progress? ```See reader-writer-nostarve.c``` for details.

6. Use semaphores to build a no-starve mutex,in which any thread that tries to acquire the mutex will eventually obtain it. See the code in ```mutex-nostarve.c``` for more information.

7. Liked these problems? See Downey’s free text for more just like them. And don’t forget, have fun! But, you always do when you write code, no?
