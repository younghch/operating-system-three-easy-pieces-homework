# Overview

In this homework, you'll be investigating swap performance with a simple
program found in `mem.c`. The program is really simple: it just allocates an
array of integers of a certain size, and then proceeds to loop through it
(repeatedly), incrementing each value in the array. 

Type `make` to build it (and look at the file `Makefile` for details about how
the build works).

Then, type `./mem` followed by a number to run it. The number is the size (in
MB) of the array. Thus, to run with a small array (size 1 MB):

```sh
prompt> ./mem 1
```

and to run with a larger array (size 1 GB):

```sh
prompt> ./mem 1024
```

The program prints out the time it takes to go through each loop as well as
the bandwidth (in MB/s). Bandwidth is particularly interesting to know as it
gives you a sense of how fast the system you're using can move through data;
on modern systems, this is likely in the GB/s range. 

Here is what the output looks like for a typical run:

```sh
prompt> ./mem 1000
allocating 1048576000 bytes (1000.00 MB)
  number of integers in array: 262144000
loop 0 in 448.11 ms (bandwidth: 2231.61 MB/s)
loop 1 in 345.38 ms (bandwidth: 2895.38 MB/s)
loop 2 in 345.18 ms (bandwidth: 2897.07 MB/s)
loop 3 in 345.23 ms (bandwidth: 2896.61 MB/s)
^C
prompt> 
```

The program first tells you how much memory it allocated (in bytes, MB, and in
the number of integers), and then starts looping through the array. The first
loop (in the example above) took 448 milliseconds; because the program
accessed the 1000 MB in just under half a second, the computed bandwidth is
(not surprisingly) just over 2000 MB/s. 

The program continues by doing the same thing over and over, for loops 1, 2,
etc. 

Important: to stop the program, you must kill it. This task is accomplished on
Linux (and all Unix-based systems) by typing control-C (^C) as shown above.

Note that when you run with small array sizes, each loop's performance numbers
won't be printed. For example:

```sh
prompt>  ./mem 1
allocating 1048576 bytes (1.00 MB)
  number of integers in array: 262144
loop 0 in 0.71 ms (bandwidth: 1414.61 MB/s)
loop 607 in 0.33 ms (bandwidth: 3039.35 MB/s)
loop 1215 in 0.33 ms (bandwidth: 3030.57 MB/s)
loop 1823 in 0.33 ms (bandwidth: 3039.35 MB/s)
^C
prompt> 
```

In this case, the program only prints out a sample of outputs, so as not to
flood the screen with too much output. 

The code itself is simple to understand. The first important part is a memory
allocation: 

```c
    // the big memory allocation happens here
    int *x = malloc(size_in_bytes);
```

Then, the main loop begins:

```c
    while (1) {
	x[i++] += 1; // main work of loop done here.
```


The rest is just timing and printing out information. See `mem.c` for details.

Much of the homework revolves around using the tool vmstat to monitor what is
happening with the system. Read the vmstat man page (type `man vmstat`) for
details on how it works, and what each column of output means.

# Questions

1. First, open two separate terminal connections to the same machine, so that you can easily run something in one window and the other. Now, in one window, run ```vmstat 1```, which shows statistics about machine usage every second. Read the man page, the associated README, and any other information you need so that you can un- derstand its output. Leave this window running vmstat for the rest of the exercises below.
Now, we will run the program ```mem.c``` but with very little memory usage. This can be accomplished by typing ```./mem 1``` (which uses only 1 MB of memory). How do the CPU usage statistics change when running mem? Do the numbers in the user time column make sense? How does this change when running more than one instance of mem at once?

2. Let’s now start looking at some of the memory statistics while running mem. We’ll focus on two columns: swpd (the amount of virtual memory used) and free (the amount of idle memory). Run ```./mem 1024``` (which allocates 1024 MB) and watch how these values change. Then kill the running program (by typing control-c) and watch again how the values change. What do you notice about the values? In particular, how does the free column change when the program exits? Does the amount of free memory increase by the expected amount when mem exits?

3. We’ll next look at the swap columns (si and so), which indicate how much swapping is taking place to and from the disk. Of course, to activate these, you’ll need to run mem with large amounts of memory. First, examine how much free memory is on your Linux system (for example, by typing cat /proc/meminfo; type man proc for details on the /proc file system and the types of information you can find there). One of the first entries in /proc/meminfo is the total amount of memory in your system. Let’s assume it’s something like 8 GB of memory; if so, start by running mem 4000 (about 4 GB) and watching the swap in/out columns. Do they ever give non-zero values? Then, try with 5000, 6000, etc. What hap- pens to these values as the program enters the second loop (and beyond), as compared to the first loop? How much data (total) are swapped in and out during the second, third, and subsequent loops? (do the numbers make sense?)

4. Do the same experiments as above, but now watch the other statis- tics (such as CPU utilization, and block I/O statistics). How do they change when mem is running?

5. Now let’s examine performance. Pick an input for mem that com- fortably fits in memory (say 4000 if the amount of memory on the system is 8 GB). How long does loop 0 take (and subsequent loops 1, 2, etc.)? Now pick a size comfortably beyond the size of memory (say 12000 again assuming 8 GB of memory). How long do the loops take here? How do the bandwidth numbers compare? How different is performance when constantly swapping versus fitting everything comfortably in memory? Can you make a graph, with the size of memory used by mem on the x-axis, and the bandwidth of accessing said memory on the y-axis? Finally, how does the perfor- mance of the first loop compare to that of subsequent loops, for both the case where everything fits in memory and where it doesn’t?

6. Swap space isn’t infinite. You can use the tool swapon with the -s flag to see how much swap space is available. What happens if you try to run mem with increasingly large values, beyond what seems to be available in swap? At what point does the memory allocation fail?

7. Finally, if you’re advanced, you can configure your system to use different swap devices using swapon and swapoff. Read the man pages for details. If you have access to different hardware, see how the performance of swapping changes when swapping to a classic hard drive, a flash-based SSD, and even a RAID array. How much can swapping performance be improved via newer devices? How close can you get to in-memory performance?
